Hi there! If you've been to my blog before you'll notice some content missing. I'll likely re-release some old content, but for now I'm starting from scratch as I move my blog from a Ghost blog, to Hugo static site. It's versioned in GitHub, deployed with Travis, and the static content lives in S3 and fronted by CloudFront and the domain is in Route53.
