Hi, I'm Jet! My passion is teaching today's software developers to write secure code as part of modern DevOps pipelines, at speed, and at scale, without missing a beat. I hold a CSSLP and GWAPT, and have several decades experience developing software solutions for numerous fortune 500 companies for over 20 years. In 2014 while managing a five nines wholesale banking platform I had a run in with InfoSec that spurred me to become a Secure Code Superhero. I spent several years building a world class AppSec program for a large healthcare insurance innovator, bootstrapping and scaling their systems from the ground up to support hundreds of developers for dozens of applications creating real DevSecOps delivery pipelines with zero hiccups. Now I'm a champion of the #DevSecOpsLIFE, sharing the vision of continuous security at DevOps speed with anyone who'll listen. I'm passionate about not just finding security defects, but training ninjas to destroy them with lightning speed.
